# Namino_Library

Namino, getting started

The Namino boards can be programmed in Windows / Linux systems, using the Arduino IDE and VS code (PlatformIO) IDE environments. These have their own installation guides, already established. The aim of the guide is how to integrate existing tutorials with Namino features.
Presentation

Our Namino system has an ESP32-S3 integrated to front end/ terminal block capable of connecting, to a machine, using 24V I/O industrial signals, 0-10V, 0-20mA, thermocouples, RTD, PTC, NTC, load cell. The front end is managed by an NXP microcontroller, with its own logic, connected to the SPI interface. Furthermore, a connector for the 3.3V Arduino shields is available.
